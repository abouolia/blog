<h1>I'm Ahmed Bouhuolia</h1>

My name is pronounced as /ahmad/

I am a software engineer based in Vancouver, Canada. I am currently working at Instacart.

This website is my humble abode on the internet, where I pen my musings in [here](/posts) and [here](/notes) about software development, specifically JavaScript, TypeScript and web technologies in general.
